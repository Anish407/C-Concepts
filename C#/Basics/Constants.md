if we look at the pic above we can see that a local variable is assigned some memory(based on the type value/reference type). But if we change the local variabale
to a constant then it gets inlined directly

## Points to Rememeber
- A constant expression is an expression that can be fully evaluated at compile time. 

- constants are implicitly static
